1. There are 1000 rows in the student performance data collection (studentperformance). There are 9 columns.

2. The goal is to use graphics to analyze the data. What elements, specifically, are influencing student performance?A. lunch; B. race/ethnicity; C. parents education level; D. gender; E. test-prep course.

3. Data pre-processing before data visualization is crucial.

4. Preprocessing steps completed:
a. Verify that no values exist.
b. Renaming the column names to improve data management
c. To accelerate the process, averaging math, writing, and reading

5. Visualization results:
a. With the aid of the subplot, we can assert with certainty that "male" is brilliant at math, while "female" dominates male in reading and writing.
b. Group E has the highest average when compared to the other groups, according to the boxplot, which shows that there is only a minor variation in the average.
c. Using a barplot, we may claim that a master's degree has a higher average score than other degrees.
d. Assisted by a stripplot It is evident that the average score for the standard feature is higher.
e. We can easily see from the swarmplot and boxplot that test_prep finished has a higher average score.
